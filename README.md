## Linting & Formatting

### Run ESLint

- Lint your codebase:
  ```sh
  npx eslint .
  ```
- Print your ESLint config:
  ```sh
  npx eslint --print-config .eslintrc.mjs
  ```
- [Next.js ESLint Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint)

- Add the ESLint extension to your editor to see squigglies for the rules in .eslintrc.mjs

### Run Prettier

- Format your entire codebase:
  ```sh
  npx prettier --write .
  ```
- (Optional) For explicit file types, consider this future script in `package.json`:
  ```json
  "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,mjs,cjs,json,css,md}\""
  ```
- Add the Prettier extension to your editor for best experience.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is set up using Jest, Babel, React Testing Library, and Jest-Stare for reporting.
The configuration can be found in `jest.config.js`, and best practices are documented in
`UNIT_TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md`.

### Key Packages

- `jest` & `jest-environment-jsdom`: Core test runner and DOM simulation
- `babel-jest`, `@babel/preset-env`, `@babel/preset-react`: Transpile modern JS/JSX for tests
- `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`: User-centric React component testing
- `jest-stare`: Generates HTML reports and visualizes test coverage
- `identity-obj-proxy`: Mocks CSS modules for component tests

### Running Tests & Viewing Coverage

- Run all tests and generate a coverage report: `npm run test:html`
- Open `jest-stare/index.html` for a visual summary of test results and coverage

### What We Test (Primarily)

- **Critical business logic** (e.g., utility functions, calculation modules)
- **Critical UI components** (e.g., authentication forms, navigation, error boundaries)
- **Authentication logic** (e.g., sign-in, sign-out, session management)
- **Pages with significant logic** (e.g., dashboard, profile, or any page with complex state)
- **Decision points** (e.g., branching logic, error handling, edge cases)

### Test Coverage Emphasis

- Ensure all major decision points and critical flows are covered
- Focus on both "happy path" and edge/error cases
- Strive for high coverage in core app logic and user-facing components

### Example Jest-Stare Report

See below for a sample of the kind of report Jest-Stare provides.

![Example Jest-Stare Report](public/test_coverage_example.png)

### Core Unit Testing Best Practices (Simplified)

- Test only the public contract (inputs/outputs, not internals)
- Cover typical, boundary, and invalid cases
- Simulate user interactions for UI components
- Mock external dependencies and side effects
- Isolate tests for clarity and maintainability
- Write one clear assertion per test
- Add regression tests for bugs
- Avoid testing implementation details or third-party internals

#### Test Coverage Types Explained (JavaScript/React/Next.js)

**% of Statements**

- Measures the percentage of all executable statements run by tests.
- In JS/React/Next, this includes variable declarations, assignments, function calls, return statements, loops, conditionals, object property access, ternary expressions, and JSX elements.
- Indicates whether test code is executing logic in your source files.

**% of Branches**

- Measures the percentage of all decision points (branches) that are executed.
- Examples: if/else, switch statements, ternary operators, logical conditions (&&, ||), optional chaining.
- Shows how well tests cover conditional logic paths; requires tests for both sides of a branch.
- Strong branch coverage improves confidence across all other metrics.

**% of Functions**

- Measures the percentage of defined functions called by your tests.
- Includes named/anonymous functions, arrow functions, React component functions, and utility/helper functions.
- Functions with 0% coverage are never invoked‚Äîpossible dead code or untested logic.

**% of Lines**

- Measures the percentage of individual lines of code executed.
- Similar to statement coverage, but easier to read; may differ slightly depending on tool parsing.

**Uncovered Line Numbers**

- Tools like `jest --coverage` list specific line numbers in each file that were never run during tests.
- Helps quickly locate gaps in test coverage.

## üìù **General Testing Insights & Best Practices**

- **Mocks:** All external dependencies (APIs, providers, CSS modules, images, etc.) are mocked in tests to ensure isolation and reliability.
- **Accessibility:** Tests use accessible queries (`getByRole`, `getByText`) to ensure components are discoverable for assistive technologies.
- **Visible Output:** Tests focus on what the user sees and interacts with, not internal implementation details.
- **Maintainability:** Explanation blocks in key test files guide future contributors on best practices and common pitfalls.
- **Error Handling:** Tests often include scenarios for missing or malformed props/data to ensure robustness.

## Pre-Commit Hooks (Husky & lint-staged)

This project uses **Husky** and **lint-staged** to automatically lint and format your code before each commit.

### How it works

- On every `git commit`, Husky runs lint-staged, which:
  - Lints and auto-formats staged JS/TS files with ESLint and Prettier
  - Formats staged JSON, CSS, and Markdown files with Prettier
- If any lint or format errors are found, the commit is blocked until they are fixed.

### Setup (already configured)

- Husky and lint-staged are installed as devDependencies.
- Husky is initialized in your repo (see `prepare` script in `package.json`).
- The `.husky/pre-commit` file runs `npx lint-staged`.
- The `lint-staged` config is in `package.json`.

### Usage

- Just stage your changes and commit as usual:
  ```sh
  git add <file>
  git commit -m "your message"
  ```
- If there are any lint/format errors, the commit will fail with an explanation.
- Fix the errors, re-stage, and try again.

## Testing

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Cyclomatic Complexity

- For more info, try tools like "Cognitive Complexity Reducer GPT".
- **General formula:**
  ```
  M = E - N + 2P
  ```
  - **M** = Cyclomatic Complexity
  - **E** = Number of edges
  - **N** = Number of nodes
  - **P** = Number of connected components (usually 1 per function)
- **Simple rule of thumb:**
  ```
  Cyclomatic Complexity = Number of decision points + 1
  ```

## ClientLayout Splash Screen & Hydration Logic

This section documents the logic and rationale behind the splash screen and hydration strategy implemented in `ClientLayout.jsx`.

### Splash Screen Display Logic

- The splash screen is always shown for a fixed duration (`splashDuration`, e.g., 3000ms) on every page load.
- The presence of a `sessionStorage` token (`splashShown`) is used only to prevent the token from being set more than once per session, **not** to skip the splash screen.
- The splash screen will always be visible for the specified duration, regardless of whether the session token is present.
- The session token is set after the splash is shown for the first time in a session, but does not affect the splash display on subsequent loads within the session.

### Hydration Strategy

- The component uses a custom `useHydrated` hook to determine if the app has been hydrated on the client.
- On the server (SSR), the splash screen is always rendered to avoid hydration mismatches.
- Once hydration is complete, the splash logic and transition to the main content are handled on the client.

### TO DO:

- Tie splash screen to auth state
- Reconsider which pages should show splash screen
  - This also ties into user journey and restricted entry points
