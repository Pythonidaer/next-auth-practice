# API: Utils

At present, there are no dedicated utility API endpoints or reusable API helper functions documented for the Meatbag application. Most endpoints are organized by functional area (auth, users, programs, workouts, collaboration, stats) and do not have shared utility routes.

If general-purpose or cross-cutting API utilities are introduced in the future (e.g., validation endpoints, shared middlewares, or reusable response helpers), they should be documented here.

## Note

- This file remains a placeholder because all current endpoints are documented under their respective modules (auth, routes, etc.), and there are no standalone utility endpoints.
