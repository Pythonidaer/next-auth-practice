# Tests: Page Routes

This document describes the test suites for the various page route components in the application.

## Overview

The application includes several page route components that follow a similar pattern:

- Simple page components that render specific content
- Tests that verify the components render correctly
- Authentication state handling where applicable

This document covers the following page routes:

- `/about` - About page
- `/account` - User account page
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard page
- `/legal` - Legal information page

## About Page

### Component Overview

The About page component (`src/app/about/page.js`):

- Renders a simple page with information about the application
- May include static content or dynamic information

### Test Cases

The test suite in `src/app/about/page.test.js` covers:

- **Basic Rendering**: Verifies the component renders without errors
- **Content Display**: Tests that expected content is present in the rendered output
- **Accessibility**: Ensures the page has proper heading structure and semantic elements

## Account Page

### Component Overview

The Account page component (`src/app/account/page.js`):

- Displays user account information and settings
- May require authentication to access
- Potentially includes forms for updating user information

### Test Cases

The test suite in `src/app/account/page.test.js` covers:

- **Authentication State**: Tests behavior with different authentication states
- **User Information Display**: Verifies user data is correctly displayed
- **Form Interactions**: Tests any forms or interactive elements
- **Protected Route Behavior**: Ensures unauthenticated users are redirected appropriately

## Dashboard Page

### Component Overview

The Dashboard page component (`src/app/dashboard/page.js`):

- Provides an overview of the user's workout progress
- Displays statistics, charts, or summary information
- Requires authentication to access

### Test Cases

The test suite in `src/app/dashboard/page.test.js` covers:

- **Authentication Requirements**: Tests redirection for unauthenticated users
- **Data Display**: Verifies workout data is correctly displayed
- **Interactive Elements**: Tests any buttons, links, or other interactive elements
- **Layout Structure**: Ensures the dashboard layout renders correctly

## Legal Page

### Component Overview

The Legal page component (`src/app/legal/page.js`):

- Displays legal information such as terms of service or privacy policy
- Contains static content that doesn't require authentication

### Test Cases

The test suite in `src/app/legal/page.test.js` covers:

- **Content Rendering**: Tests that all legal text sections are present
- **Link Functionality**: Verifies any internal or external links work correctly
- **Accessibility**: Ensures legal content is accessible with proper heading structure

## Testing Techniques Applied

These test suites demonstrate several testing techniques:

1. **Authentication State Testing**:

   - Tests components with different authentication states where applicable
   - Verifies protected routes redirect unauthenticated users

2. **Content Verification**:

   - Tests that expected text content is present
   - Verifies dynamic content is correctly displayed based on props or state

3. **Component Isolation**:

   - Uses mocks for dependencies like authentication providers
   - Tests components in isolation from the rest of the application

4. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Verifies proper heading structure and semantic HTML
   - Tests keyboard navigation where applicable

## Why These Tests Matter

These tests are important because:

1. **Route Coverage**: Ensures all application routes render correctly
2. **Authentication Logic**: Verifies protected routes handle authentication correctly
3. **User Experience**: Confirms that users see the expected content on each page
4. **Regression Prevention**: Protects against regressions when modifying page components

The test suites follow best practices by focusing on user-visible behavior and component output rather than implementation details.
