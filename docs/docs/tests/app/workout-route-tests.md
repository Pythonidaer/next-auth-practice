# Tests: Workout Dynamic Route

This document describes the test suite for the workout dynamic route component located at `src/app/workout/[day]/[exercise]/page.js`.

## Component Overview

The Workout page component handles dynamic routes with two parameters:

- `[day]` - Represents the workout day number
- `[exercise]` - Represents the exercise index within that day

This component:

- Displays exercise details for a specific day and exercise index
- Shows exercise name, sets, reps, and other information
- Provides navigation between exercises
- May include timer functionality or exercise completion tracking
- Requires authentication to access

## Test Cases

The test suite in `src/app/workout/[day]/[exercise]/page.test.js` covers the following scenarios:

### Route Parameter Handling

- **Parameter Extraction**: Tests that day and exercise parameters are correctly extracted from the URL
- **Invalid Parameters**: Tests behavior when invalid parameters are provided
- **Parameter Boundaries**: Verifies handling of edge cases (first/last exercise, first/last day)

### Exercise Display

- **Exercise Information**: Tests that exercise details are correctly displayed
  - Verifies exercise name is shown
  - Confirms sets and reps information is displayed
  - Tests that any additional exercise details are present

### Navigation

- **Exercise Navigation**: Tests navigation between exercises
  - Verifies "Next Exercise" button navigates to the next exercise
  - Tests "Previous Exercise" button navigates to the previous exercise
  - Confirms navigation to the next day when reaching the last exercise

### Authentication

- **Protected Route**: Tests that the route requires authentication
  - Verifies unauthenticated users are redirected to sign-in
  - Confirms authenticated users can access the page

## Testing Techniques Applied

This test suite demonstrates several advanced testing techniques:

1. **Dynamic Route Testing**:

   - Tests components that rely on dynamic route parameters
   - Mocks the Next.js useParams hook to simulate different route parameters

2. **Navigation Testing**:

   - Tests navigation between exercises and days
   - Verifies correct URL construction for dynamic routes

3. **Data Integration**:

   - Tests integration with workout data sources
   - Verifies correct exercise data is displayed based on route parameters

4. **Authentication Integration**:
   - Tests authentication requirements for protected routes
   - Verifies redirection behavior for unauthenticated users

## Why These Tests Matter

These tests are important because:

1. **Core Functionality**: The workout pages are central to the application's purpose
2. **Dynamic Routing**: Ensures the dynamic route parameters work correctly
3. **User Experience**: Confirms that users can navigate through exercises smoothly
4. **Data Integrity**: Verifies that exercise data is correctly displayed based on parameters

The test suite follows best practices by:

- Testing parameter extraction and validation
- Verifying correct content display based on parameters
- Testing navigation between related routes
- Ensuring authentication requirements are enforced
