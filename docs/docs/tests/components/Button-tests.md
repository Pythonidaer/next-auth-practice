# Tests: Button Component

This document describes the test suite for the `Button` component located at `src/components/Button/Button.jsx`.

## Component Overview

The `Button` component is a reusable UI element that:

- Provides consistent button styling across the application
- Supports multiple color variants (blue, red, green, white)
- Allows for icon integration
- Handles click events
- Supports different button types (button, submit)

## Test Cases

The test suite in `src/components/Button/Button.test.jsx` covers the following scenarios:

### Default Rendering

- **Default Props**: Verifies that the button renders correctly with minimal props
  - Confirms button is in the document
  - Verifies default type attribute is "button"
  - Checks that default styling classes are applied

### Style Variants

- **Color Variants**: Tests each color variant of the button
  - Renders the button with each supported color (blue, red, green, white)
  - Confirms the appropriate CSS class is applied for each color

### Icon Support

- **Icon Rendering**: Tests the button's ability to display an icon
  - Confirms the icon is rendered in the document
  - Verifies the icon wrapper has the appropriate CSS class

### Interaction

- **Click Handling**: Tests the button's click behavior
  - Simulates a user clicking the button
  - Verifies the onClick handler is called exactly once

### Attribute Support

- **Button Types**: Tests that the button supports different HTML button types
  - Renders a button with type="submit"
  - Confirms the correct type attribute is applied

### Accessibility

- **Accessibility Support**: Tests that the button is accessible
  - Confirms the button can be found by its role and label
  - Ensures screen readers can properly identify the button

## Testing Techniques Applied

This test suite demonstrates several best practices:

1. **Component Isolation**: Tests focus on the Button component in isolation
2. **CSS Module Mocking**: CSS modules are mocked to avoid style-related test failures
3. **User Interaction Simulation**: Uses fireEvent to simulate user clicks
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Tests focus on accessibility by using role-based queries
5. **Comprehensive Props Testing**: Tests all supported props and their combinations

## Why These Tests Matter

These tests are important because:

1. **UI Consistency**: The Button component is used throughout the application, making its reliability critical
2. **Reusable Component**: As a foundational UI element, bugs in this component could affect many features
3. **Accessibility**: Tests ensure the button remains accessible to all users
4. **Visual Variants**: Tests verify that all visual variants work as expected

The test suite follows the project's best practices for React component testing, focusing on user-visible behavior rather than implementation details.
