# Tests: Coverage

## Overview

This document is designed with the intention to capture test coverage status (with images) up to a certain date. Currently, this document serves more as a placeholder as the tests and coverage reflect a pre-MVP mockup, and will be updated once true data integration has started.

## Current Status

At this stage of development, our test coverage is focused on:

- UI component rendering and interactions
- Utility functions like `getFirstName.js`
- Basic authentication flows

Full integration testing and comprehensive coverage reports will be added after the initial data integration phase is complete.

## Future Documentation

Once the application moves beyond the mockup phase, this document will be updated to include:

- Jest coverage reports with screenshots
- Coverage metrics by component and feature
- Identified coverage gaps and plans to address them
- Historical coverage trends

## Coverage Goals

For the MVP release, we aim to achieve the following Jest coverage metrics:

- 80%+ coverage for utility functions
- 70%+ coverage for UI components
- 60%+ coverage for component integration tests
